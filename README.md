# JavaScript-Calculator
 Html, CSS and JavaScript based calculator.
 Here's a breakdown of how I tackled each aspect of
the task:

HTML Structure:
HTML provided the structural backbone, allowing me to meticulously organize elements and establish the calculator's layout with precision. I began by laying out the structure of the calculator in HTML. I created a display screen to show user input and results, along with buttons for digits, decimal point, and arithmetic operations.

CSS Styling:
I applied CSS styles to enhance the appearance and layout of the calculator. I utilized CSS grid system for button alignments, ensuring that the calculator looked clean and organized.

JavaScript Functionality:
However, it was JavaScript that truly brought the calculator to life, enabling dynamic functionality such as arithmetic operations, input validation, and responsive feedback. Implementing event listeners and meticulously crafting algorithms, I imbued the calculator with intelligence, allowing users to effortlessly perform calculations with ease. The core functionality of the calculator was implemented using JavaScript. 

Testing and Debugging:
Throughout the development process, I rigorously
tested the calculator to ensure that it functioned
correctly under various scenarios. I debugged any issues that arose, refining the code until the calculator performed as expected.

Final Touches:
Once the calculator was fully functional, I added
some final touches to improve the user experience.
This included implementing a clear button to reset the display, handling edge cases, and ensuring the
calculator was responsive on different devices.

Overall, completing this task has strengthened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in web development.
